# Usertask

## Design For task1 Managers:

One user can have multiple managers and multiple underlings,

User can assign or unassign there manager in "set manager" page.

On user's home page user is able to see there  managers and underlings.

User can only assign  their underlings' a task on "New task page".

User can see and edit tasks , which they assigned to their underlings, on "Task Report Page",

When user click "show" link on  "Task Report Page", it will direct to a task's details and its timestamp


## Design For task2 Detailed Time Spent:

On "My Task" Page user can see list of his/her tasks.

When user click "Task Tracker" button on "My Task" Page, it will direct to "Task Tracker" page

On "Task Tracker" page, user can press a "start working" and "stop working" button on the "Task Tracker" page,

and this should create a block of time spent working on the task,

user also can manually add timestamp via "add timestamp" button.

user can manually edit list of timestamp showed on "Task Tracker" page.
